<p id="textt"> It’s hard to think of a game more natural than Guess My Number. Kids can immediately start playing, and have a great time doing it. 
    The game is also a perfect way to introduce the basics of logical thought and strategy, and let the game do the teaching with only minimal extra observations from the teacher. 
    Surprisingly repayable and enjoyable, this is a great game to play early and often.</p>
